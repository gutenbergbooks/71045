THE<br>
INTERPRETATION<br>
OF<br>
DREAMS AND MOLES.<br>
</p>

<hr class="r5">

<h2 id="toc1">INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Dreams, though some, very ignorant
in such rare mysteries, have slighted
them, are, by the Sages and Wise Men of
all ages, considered very significant; and
that the soul, when the body reposes, being
disencumbered from gross and weighty cares
for the flesh, by this unknown mysterious
way confabulates or converses with Spirits
of Angels, who bring to its knowledge future
events, very strange and wonderful;
as in scripture we find it in Pharaoh’s, Nebuchadnezzar’s,
and other dreams, that
exactly came to pass, according to their interpretations.
But not to prolong the matter,
I proceed, by the rules of art, to give
the interpretation of Dreams.</p>

respect.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toc3">ADVICE<br><span class="small">TO ALL<br><i>Bachelors, Maids, Widowers, and Widows</i>.</span></h2>
</div>

<hr class="r5">
<p>There are certain Rules which must be
observed in Courtship: And first, to maids
who have not possessed their first blushes,
your first addresses must be with gentleness
and modesty, lest you fright them with an
opinion that you are rude and uncivil of
behaviour, and rather aim at debauching
them than at marriage: And you must be
brisk with them, or they will take you for
a drone without a sting.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Widows, especially the young ones, are
gamesome and buxom, for having once
smelt to the spit, they always love a good
joint; those you must entertain with some
merry discourse, and lay aside whining or
solemn protestations; kiss them till their
ears crack; and when you find a convenient
time and place, warm them with caresses,
squeezing their hand, gently treading on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
their toes; and when you kiss, bear close
to them, and you will soon perceive, by
their eager looks, blushing, and their often
changing of colour, that now is the time
to ask a favour, to which you will have
a faint denial, if any at all, and then make
use of your time, and press forward without
delays, for they are dangerous; and many
a fair opportunity has slipt, that could not
be recovered, though earnestly pursued.</p>

<p>As for maids or widows, if you like a
brisk man, and are bashful, you may use
dumb signs, which is called love’s silent
language, gaze on his face; then, when
he perceives it, suddenly take off your eyes,
and turn your head aside, blush naturally,
forcingly hold in your breathing, and start
a little when first you see him at any time,
as if you were surprized; if he takes you
by the hand, grasp him with a little trembling,
and then seem to withdraw your hand
again, as if uneasy. If he kisses you, stay
your lips on his awhile, with great affection;
and he must be very dull that will
not take these for the signs of tender love.</p>

<p>Above all things, either man or woman
ought to conduct themselves with perfect
modesty and decorum, in the presence of
those they esteem, as it is the most certain
method of gaining their esteem and love.</p>

<p>More might be said on this subject, but
nature and practice are the best instructors.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p>To know this, which hath been held for
a great secret, put their Christian and Sirnames
together, and consider what numbers
the letters make that stand for numbers
in them; as the I, stands for one;
V, for five; X, for ten; L, for fifty;
C, for a hundred; M, for a thousand;
D, for five hundred, &amp;c. Write every letter
on a separate piece of paper, roll them up,
and put the billets into any thing, and then
shake them together: And, in drawing, if
the number of your names comes up to
what it would, in so many billets which,
you put in for, you will be happy in your
desire; but if a cross number arise, you
will meet with many disappointments.</p>

<p>The hair in this case is commonly very
remarkable and most significant.</p>

<p>Black hair signifies the person rash, choleric,
given much to quarrels and strife;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
but if it be soft and pliable, the person is
moderately meek and humble, of a free
temper and good nature.</p>

<p>Dark brown hair signifies an indifferent
good temper loving and affable, one easy
to be wrought on with good usage.</p>

<p>Light brown hair, that is not harsh or
broken at the ends, shews the party very
loving and good natured, industrious and
patient in the pleasure of marriage.</p>

<p>Flaxen hair is Venus’s own colour, and
rarely fails, in any one, to render a soft,
kind temper, usually of a fair and sanguine
complexion, very amorous, and apt to love.</p>

<p>Dusky red hair, shews the person melancholy,
and of a morose temper, not much
subject to love, but covetous, and anxious
to obtain honour and riches.</p>

<p>Bright or deep red hair shews the party
to be very lecherous; one that will have
many children, and very pleasing in marriage;
yet apt to stray if satisfaction in marriage
fails. It also signifieth the party
wise and industrious, not designed for great
riches.</p>

<p>Any colours that are intermixed between
these, participate equally of the temper,
qualities, good nature, and humours, that I
have mentioned in the degrees of mixtures.
And thus many a man or woman may
make their conjecture, and so be happy.</p>

<h3 id="toc6"><i>Signs of Love and speedy Marriage, or the contrary,
by seeing or meeting divers sorts of
creatures at first in the mornings and various
other circumstances.</i></h3>


<p>These signs of love and marriage, have
been greatly taken notice of, in their exact
succeeding, according to the desire of the
parties, and are as follows, <i>viz.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. For a woman to have the first and
last letters of her Christian name the same
with the man’s Sir-name that makes love
to her, denotes a happy union, and that
the man will be a generous lover.</p>

<p>2. For the man to have the first and last
letters of his Christian name the same with
the woman’s Sir-name, denotes the same.</p>

<p>3. To think on a person upon sudden
waking, without any meditation, upon a
Friday morning, that before had a place in
the affections of a man or woman, is a demonstration
that love or extraordinary
friendship will take place between them.</p>

<p>4. If a ring accidently fall off a man’s
finger that is under no obligation of marriage,
and runs directly to the foot of a
maid or widow, it denotes not only he is
in love with the party, but that a sudden
marriage will ensue between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>5. If a robin red-breast comes fluttering
to your window, and sings very pleasantly,
perching near it, it denotes a very speedy
marriage.</p>

<p>6. If a hare start in your way, and run
on your right hand, you will have success
in love affairs; but if she cross you, or run
on the left hand, it denotes you will be interrupted
by others as rivals.</p>

<p>7. If swallows chatter merrily, and sing
in the chimney of the chamber where you
lie, it denotes you will have many sweethearts,
and be kindly treated.</p>

<p>8. Bats fluttering at your window, betokens
misfortunes in love. The croaking
of ravens being the first thing you hear in
the morning, denotes the same.</p>

<p>9. To meet a sow, on first going out in
the morning, carrying straw in her mouth,
denotes that a maid or widow will soon be
married, and be fruitful in children.</p>

<p>10. To hear magpies chatter, and flying
about as you walk abroad, denotes much
strife and brawling in marriage.</p>

<p>11. If walking abroad with your sweetheart
you perceive a pair of pigeons encircle
you round, it is a sign of marriage and
happiness to ensue, with contentment.</p>

<p>12. If one drops their garter, when going
to see their sweetheart, it denotes they
will meet with a cold reception.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="Htoc5"><i>How to choose a good Husband or Wife.</i></h3>


<p>1. If the man be of a ruddy complexion,
high and full nosed, his eye-brows bending
archwise, his eyes standing full, of a black
and lively colour it denotes him to be good
natured, ingenious, and born to good fortune;
and the same of a woman, if she be
born under the planet Jupiter.</p>

<p>2. If a party be phlegmatic, lean, and
of a dusky complexion, and much given to
musing or melancholy, beware of such an
one, of what sex soever.</p>

<p>3. An indifferent wide mouth, with full
cheeks, smooth forehead, little ears, dark
brown hair, and a chin proportionable to
the face, is very promising.</p>

<p>4. An extraordinary thin chin, with the
under lip larger than the upper, signifies a
cross grained person, fit for little performance,
yet given to great folly.</p>

<p>5. A long nose on a man, and a little
mouth in a woman, signifies neither can be
deceived in their marriage views.</p>

<p>6. A well set broad chin in a man, his
face being round, and not too great, and
a dimple or dint in a woman’s cheek or
chin, denotes they will come together, and
live happy in their married state.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toc7">ART OF PALMISTRY.</h2>
</div>


<h3><i>Several Characters or Semblance of Letters and
Lines in the Hand, as they tend to signify
Riches, Honour, long Life, short Life, Poverty,
Loss, number of Wives, or Children, Sickness;
untimely Death and many other things,
according to the Art of Palmistry.</i></h3>


<p>There are in this case divers Letters and
Lines appearing in the hand, by which the
wise of all ages have given judgment, in the
foregoing premises.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. If the character A, be found on the
mount of <i>Jupiter</i>, or the root of the middle
finger, it promises a growing fortune, and
perhaps considerable preferment, by the favour
of princes and great men.</p>

<p>2. If a B be found on the mount of the
<i>Sun</i>, which is at the root of the fourth finger,
it signifies length of days, prosperity,
much to be credited, also a virtuous person.</p>

<p>3. If O, with a star over it, appears on
the mount of <i>Venus</i>, it gives the person early
and happy marriage, promises many children,
and a merry and happy life.</p>

<p>4. If the letter L be on the mount of
<i>Saturn</i>, which is at the root of the middle
finger, and be cut with cross lines, it denotes
the party to undergo much affliction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
to be given up to melancholy, and to be
but very tender and of short life, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. the letter K, upon the mount of <i>Mercury</i>,
which is at the root of the little finger,
denotes the party to rise to preferment by
ingenuity and a happy marriage.</p>

<p>6. The letter D, on the mount of the
Moon, denotes the party to be kind and
good-natured, and much beloved.</p>

<p>7. The letter G, in the plain of <i>Mars</i>,
near the line of life, speaks the party to be
of a violent temper, given up to anger, and
threatens him or her with sudden or untimely
death: However, to a woman it promises
a good husband, that shall grow great in
military affairs.—Thus much for the characters
of this kind on the hand.</p>
</div>


<hr class="r5">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="toc8"><i>Lines in the Hand, and their Significations, relating
to Love, Marriage, Business, &amp;c.</i></h3>



<p>1. If the Table Line be broad, fair, and
well coloured, it signifies the party, if a
man, will have two wives; if a woman, as
many husbands, and lucky marriages.</p>

<p>2. If the Line of life extends itself from
the root of the fore finger to the mount of
the Moon, or the brawn of the hand, it
then denotes long life: but if it be cut short,
and divided by many crosses, the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>3. If the girdle of <i>Venus</i>, which reaches
from the outside of the hand to the root
of the middle finger, be fair and well proportioned,
not cut or divided by cross lines,
it denotes to the party extraordinary advantage
by marriage.——Several little crosses
upon the Liver line, which runs directly
upon the hand, denotes sickness and an
unhealthy constitution; but if it be fair
and clean it signifies health and long life.</p>

<p>4. If little direct lines come from the
root of the finger, they signify to a woman
to have three husbands; and to a man,
great riches, honour, and preferment.</p>

<p>5. If they have three large lines on the
joint of the wrist, it denotes easy childbearing,
and not subject to miscarriage.</p>

<p>6. If the nails of the hand be transparent,
red, long, and of a fair complexion, it
is a sign of long life; but if cloudy, dark,
or of a lead colour, the contrary.</p>

<p>7. If the line branch toward the fore and
middle finger, and end blunt, it betokens
riches and preferment to men; and to women,
kind and loving husbands.</p>

<p>8. If there happen a cut or separation between
your two left fingers, it denotes loss
if not ruin to the party, by commerce or
law-suits—Thus much for these Lines, and
for their different significations.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
